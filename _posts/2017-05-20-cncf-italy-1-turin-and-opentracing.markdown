## What is CNCF?

CNCF is a branch of The Linux Foundation focused on Cloud Computing and modern
scalable architectures. It's supporting tools like Kubernetes, Prometheus,
containerd and so on. If you are using one of them or you are looking to know
more about them, this is your meetup. Join us! hashtag #CNCFItaly on twitter.

## About the Event

This will be a full evening about OpenTracing. OpenTracing turns the light on
for microservices
(https://www.cncf.io/blog/2016/10/20/opentracing-turning-the-lights-on-for-microservices/).
It is a specification to store and manage trace. How can we follow what's going
on from the beginning to the end of our requests? What's happening when they
cross different services? Where is the bottleneck? Tracing helps you to
understand what's going on. It's not just for microservices but also for
caching, queue system an so on. Have a look at the trends
https://trends.google.it/trends/explore?q=opentracing you need to know!

The event will be in Turin, we are still waiting for the final destination, but
it's coming soon!

## Schedule

19.00 - 19.45 Overview and Opentracing in theory by Gianluca Arbezzano

That is this group? How does it work? What is the CNCF? After this short
introduction I am going to show you what is Opentracing what it means and why
the adoption is growing so much in a short amount of time. Use cases, possible
implementations and so on.

19.45 - 20.30 Trace your micro-services oriented application with Zipkin and
OpenTracing

A practical approach to OpenTracing in a PHPmicroservices application. In this
talk, we will focus on Zipkin and OpenTracing. An example of integration in an
online application clarifies our needs of tracing and measuring things in our
softwares, simply because measure is the key to science.

20.30-21.30 Networking, Pizza and Beers
