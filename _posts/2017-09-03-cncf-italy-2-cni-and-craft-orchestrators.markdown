title:  "#2 CNI and craft container orchestrators"
description: "CNI is a powerful library designed to manage container networking. It's a
project started by CoreOS and it is used under the hood from a lot of popular
OSS projects like kubernetes, the legacy swarm and so on. Lorenzo will show us
how it works in practice and how it is under the Cloud Native Foundation.

After this talk, Gianluca will start a conversation about container runtime,
distributed system and orchestator. He is building the automation tools behind
https://cloud.influxdata.com/ the as a service solution to use a hosted InfluxDB
and the TICK stack."

## About the event

CNI is a powerful library designed to manage container networking. It's a
project started by CoreOS and it is used under the hood from a lot of popular
OSS projects like kubernetes, the legacy swarm and so on. Lorenzo will show us
how it works in practice and how it is under the Cloud Native Foundation.

After this talk, Gianluca will start a conversation about container runtime,
distributed system and orchestator. He is building the automation tools behind
https://cloud.influxdata.com/ the as a service solution to use a hosted InfluxDB
and the TICK stack.

## Schedule

**7.00 - 7.45 Practical CNI [ENG]**

The Container Network Interface project redefined the way we connect containers
and think about networks when using the container runtimes that implemented the
specification, however the specification hides a lot of interesting
implementation details addressed by the project itself or external plugin. The
purpose of this talk is to tackle the topic in a practical way by showing what's
under the CNI and by showcasing cool hacks and usage scenarios.

**7.45 - 8.30 CNI, Raft, CRI rocket.. free chat about craf container orchestrator [ENG]**

I would like to speak about what I am actually doing at InfluxData. Sharing with
you some ideas about how an orchestrator should work. We will start from a bit
of history about distributed system, containers, runtime and so on. Hoping to
have a good chat about the future of scheduling and orchestrator.

**20.30-21.30 Networking, Pizza and Beers**
