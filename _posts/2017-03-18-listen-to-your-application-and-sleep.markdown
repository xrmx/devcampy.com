Our application speaks, time series are one of their languages. During this talk
I will share how to use the open source Tick Stack to spin up a modern
monitoring system for your application and your infrastructure. DevOps, cloud
computing and containers changed how we are writing and running our
applications. This talk shows what InfluxData and the community is building to
have a modern and flexible monitoring toolkit.
