### Schedule

**7.00 - 7.45 Arduino Create migration: from EC2 to Kubernetes. By Luca Cipriani**

A scalable architecture on a single domain and a path based routing.  How
Arduino moved most of the new APIs from EC2 to Kubernetes using a custom ingress
based on Caddy Server. The api2.arduin.cc endpoint now have couple thousand
req/s 7.45 - 8.30 Second talk will be published soon!

**7-45 - 8.30 Kubernetes Beyond**

Kubernetes is a top noch framework providing the foundations for the
orchestration and life-cicle management of cloud-native applications.  Despite
the incredible set of features provided out of the box by k8s, sometimes
applications require the automation of specific maintenance taks and/or custom
orchestration in order to be successfully deployed and maintained in the
long-term.  Recalling the Star Trek Beyond movie the title of the talk takes
inspiration from, in this session we will present how Kubernetes can be extended
using Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) and Operators bringing Kubernetes
automation to the next level.

20.30-21.30 Aperitivo and networking sponsored by. Leva Engineering
