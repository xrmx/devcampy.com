title:  "So You Wanna Go Fast?"
description: "Go's simplicity and concurrency model make it an appealing choice
for backend systems, but how does it fare for latency-sensitive applications? In
this talk, we explore the other side of the coin by providing some tips on
writing high-performance Go and lessons learned in the process. We do a deep
dive on low-level performance optimizations in order to make Go a more
compelling option in the world of systems programming, but we also consider
the trade-offs involved."

Go's simplicity and concurrency model make it an appealing choice for backend
systems, but how does it fare for latency-sensitive applications? In this talk,
we explore the other side of the coin by providing some tips on writing
high-performance Go and lessons learned in the process. We do a deep dive on
low-level performance optimizations in order to make Go a more compelling option
in the world of systems programming, but we also consider the trade-offs
involved.

Tyler Treat is a Senior Software Engineer at Apcera working on NATS, an
open-source messaging system for cloud-native applications. Previously, Tyler
was a Product Development Manager with Workiva's Infrastructure and Reliability
team. He is interested in distributed systems, messaging infrastructure, and
resilience engineering. Tyler is also a frequent open-source contributor and
avid blogger at bravenewgeek.com.
