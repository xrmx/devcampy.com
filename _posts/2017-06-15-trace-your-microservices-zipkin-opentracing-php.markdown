A practical approach to OpenTracing in a set of PHP microservice applications. In this
talk, we will focus on Zipkin and OpenTracing. An example of integration in an
online application clarifies our needs of tracing and measuring things in our
Software, simply because measure is the key to science.

You can have a look at a Symfony Bundle to integrate opentracing in your application on
[GitHub](https://github.com/wdalmut/opentracing-bundle).
