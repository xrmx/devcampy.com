The container has become one of the most overloaded industry buzzwords of the
last five years. From Jails to LXC to Zones to systemd-nspawn Docker to rkt -
there's an assortment of different tools on different platforms that call
themselves containers, and no clear consensus what it means when it comes to
distributing containers or implementing the underlying technical details. The
Open Container Initiative was formed in 2015 to try to remedy this situation by
establishing a shared set of container standards for different implementers to
agree on. With representatives from all major server operating system platforms,
the Initiative has made great strides towards specifying a truly interoperable
container. The two key OCI projects recently hit their canonical 1.0 version;
this talk will explain what OCI is and what that milestone means for the
container ecosystem.
