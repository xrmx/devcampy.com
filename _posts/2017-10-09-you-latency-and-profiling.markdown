title:  "You, latency and profiling @ GolangUK 2017"
description: "When we talk about a 'fast' service we often don't mean one that
can process 500MB/s per core, but one that can respond in less than 5ms.
However, many causes of latency are invisible to network operations, disk reads,
locks, channels, scheduling. Let's see how to use the new tracer to profile
them."

causes of latency are invisible to network operations, disk reads, locks,
