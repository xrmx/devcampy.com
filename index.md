	<b>Camp</b> (n.) and <b>Campy</b> (adj.): Being so extreme that it has an amusing
					and sometimes perversely sophisticated appeal. Over the top and
					farcical, intentionally exaggerated so as not to be taken seriously.
					Found primarily in television, theatre and motion pictures, camp
					endeavors for satire and, for those who fully understand and
					appreciate the risible nature of its material, it's not surprising
					when it develops a cult following.</p>

				  Welcome to DevCampy
				  <small class="text-muted">Just an overview about What we are.</small>
				</h2>
				<p>DevCampy is a <b>group of curious developers</b>,
					oriented to be <b>part of a community</b>. We organise and we attend
					Meetups, Conferences because learning and sharing knowledge
					is the best way to grow as developer and human. Share what
					you learned in your local community or with people far away
					is a fantastic way to measure your skills and to give
					something back at the communities.</p>
				<p>DevCampy organises Meetups and events mostly
					oriented to Cloud Computing, Development, Automation,
					Containers and so on...</p>
				<p>As organisers we know the effort that everyone puts
					to have an event running. For this reason we decided to share
					our experience as organisers. Locations, networking,
					sponsorship, diversity and everything related to event organisation. If
					you are a meetup organiser or you are
					thinking to start this amazing adventure reach us out via
					twitter (<b>@gianarb</b>) or via email
					<b>gianarb92(at)gmail(dot).com</b>.</p>
