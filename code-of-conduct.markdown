an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute
through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation,
submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.</p>

<p>We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,
sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age,
religion, or nationality.</p>

    <li>Personal attacks</li>
    <li>Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments</li>
    <li>Public or private harassment</li>
    <li>Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses,

    <li>Other unethical or unprofessional conduct.</li>
</ul>

<p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not

when an individual is representing the project or its community.</p>
