The Container Network Interface project redefined the way we connect containers
and think about networks when using the container runtimes that implemented the
specification, however the specification hides a lot of interesting
implementation details addressed by the project itself or external plugin. The
purpose of this talk is to tackle the topic in a practical way by showing whatâ€™s
under the CNI and by showcasing cool hacks and usage scenarios.
